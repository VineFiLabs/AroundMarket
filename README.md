# Around - Decentralized Self-Yielding Prediction Market

## Project Overview

Around is a blockchain-based decentralized prediction market platform that allows users to make Yes/No predictions on various events (cryptocurrency, sports, games, politics, economy, technology, weather, etc.). The platform employs an Automated Market Maker (AMM) mechanism combined with a virtual liquidity model to provide users with a smooth trading experience. Additionally, the platform integrates with the Aave protocol, enabling pools to automatically generate yields, achieving the "self-yielding" feature.

## Core Features

### 1. 🏛️ Prediction Market Functionality
- **Market Creation**: Users can create various types of prediction markets
- **Bidirectional Trading**: Supports Yes/No predictions and trading in both directions
- **Real-time Pricing**: Dynamic price discovery mechanism based on AMM model
- **Liquidity Provision**: Users can add liquidity and earn trading fees

### 2. 🔄 Self-Yielding Mechanism
- **Aave Integration**: Pools can optionally deposit funds into the Aave protocol
- **Auto-compounding**: Yields from Aave are automatically reinvested into the pool
- **Flexible Configuration**: Each market can independently configure whether to enable Aave yields

### 3. ⚖️ Decentralized Oracle
- **Optimistic Oracle**: Uses EchoOptimisticOracle for result determination
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Supports multiple data providers submitting results
- **Dispute Mechanism**: Includes challenge and dispute voting mechanisms to ensure result accuracy
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Data providers who submit correct results receive rewards

### 4. 🎰 Reward Mechanism
- **Lucky Pool (LuckyPool)**: Users who reach the trading volume threshold can participate in a lottery
- **Creator Rewards**: Market creators receive a portion of trading fees
- **NFT Discounts**: Users holding ELF NFTs enjoy 50% fee discounts

### 5. 🛡️ Risk Management
- **Multi-signature Management**: Critical operations require multi-signature confirmation
- **Invalid Market Mechanism**: Supports marking invalid markets as InvalidMarket

## 🏗️ System Architecture

## 📊 Pricing Mechanism

### Virtual Liquidity AMM Model

The platform uses a virtual liquidity-based AMM pricing model with the formula:

```
P_yes = (yesAmount + virtualLiquidity) / (yesAmount + noAmount + 2 * virtualLiquidity)
P_no = 1 - P_yes
```

Where:
- `yesAmount`: Total Yes shares
- `noAmount`: Total No shares
- `virtualLiquidity`: Virtual liquidity (initial value configurable)

Virtual liquidity provides initial price discovery capability, ensuring markets have a reasonable initial price (0.5) even without trades.

### Trading Fee Structure

Total fee rate: Default 0.6% (600/100000)

Fee distribution:
- **Official Fee**: 0.2% (200/100000) - To platform
- **Liquidity Fee**: 0.15% (150/100000) - To liquidity providers
- **Oracle Fee**: 0.1% (100/100000) - To oracle data providers
- **Lucky Fee**: 0.075% (75/100000) - To lottery pool
- **Creator Fee**: 0.075% (75/100000) - To market creator

Users holding ELF NFTs enjoy a 50% fee discount.
